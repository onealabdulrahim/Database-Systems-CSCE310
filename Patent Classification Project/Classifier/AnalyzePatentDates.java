//This program illustrates processing fields in a patent document stored in a MongoDB collection.
//Each patent has the following JSON fields: {"patNum":"D238414","iDate":"January 13, 1976","title":"","abstract":"","inventors":"","assignee":"","familyID":"","applNum":"","dateFiled":"","docID":"","pubDate":"","USclass":"D10/50","references":"","claims":"","examiner":"","legalfirm":"","summary":"","description":""}
//All field values are presented as strings, but might be better stored in the database as different 
//types to facilitate comparisons (e.g. DATE type)
//The field "inventors" may have multiple subfields representing individual inventors, but the data is presented as a single String. It needs to be further parsed. 
//The fields "references" and "claims" may have subfields, and if so they are presented as JSON subfields named “ref#” and “claim#” where # is a number. E.g. ref14 or claim7
//Text fields like "abstract", "claims", "summary" and "description" make be large text strings (thousands of characters).
